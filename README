Four in a line

This is one of classic pen-and-paper games. This task is to implement a client application
and a server hosting any number of games. It is a server's responsibility to pair clients and
check when the game ends. For each pair of clients, the server creates a separate thread. All
communication is realized by TCP sockets. After connecting to the server, a client can list 
existing games - both paired and unpaired, player nicks and game board size. Then, the 
connected client can choose to watch an existing game, connect to other unpaired client and 
start the game or create his own game. Clients are not paired automatically. When a client 
creates a game it chooses a nick and game board size (varying from 4 to 20). When a client is
connected, a board is displayed with the current game state. During the game, clients in a
pair can chat privately with each other. After the game client is not disconnected, it can 
start all over again.
